# Discord.js v12.5.3 Bot Template

Advanced Discord.js bot template created in Node.js.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you to install all required modules and
launch your discord bot.

### Requirements

You must have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com) installed.

### Installing npm modules

1. Click Ctrl+Shift+` on your keyboard (Terminal should open)
2. Type "npm install" in your terminal

Now wait some time till all modules will install

### Deploing bot

To launch your bot you need to provide the necessary information in the Config.js file such as client token, client owners and prefix.
When all informations are provided, type "node index.js" in your terminal.
If all went well, you should see in the terminal information about loading commands etc. the last line should say that your client is ready. If something went wrong you can contact the author of the project ([FUS3K#5450](https://discord.com/users/442016669720903680)) on discord.
